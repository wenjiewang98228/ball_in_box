# ball_in_box

This program is used to solve a algorithm problem.


The detailed description is that in a given box by [-1,1], given m balloons(they cannot overlap) with variable radio r and position mu, some tiny blocks  are in the box at given posiion {d}, which balloons cannot overlap with, we should find the optimal value of r nd mu which maxmizes sum r^2.
