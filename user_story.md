## user stories

A user can find the optimal value of r and mu which maximizes and sum r^2. 

 1. A user can get a limited box bounded by [-1,1] with a certain number and position of samll blocks and .
 2. A user can get the exact number of balllons.
 3. A user can obtain the maximum radius(r) and the position(mu) of the ballons which do not overlap with those blocks.
 4. A user can view the sum of squares of the variable radius.
